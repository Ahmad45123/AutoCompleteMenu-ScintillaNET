# AutoCompleteMenu
This library is a general auto complete menu library based on the [library originally created by Pavel Torgashov](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/365974/Autocomplete-Menu).

## Features
- The main feature is adding support for ScintillaNET via a new ScintillaWrapper. The wrapper can be enabled as simple as doing `AutoComplete.TargetControlWrapper = new ScintillaWrapper(scintilla1);`.
- Fixed many bugs in the original library.
- Added support for multiple columns.
- Added AutoWidth feature.
- Added ability to colorize backcolor and forecolor of tooltips.

And many more.. The library is not documented well so feel free to open issues [in the repository](https://github.com/Ahmad45123/AutoCompleteMenu-ScintillaNET/issues) for any questions or feature requests.
